Notes related to the usage of the New England Research Cloud


## Latest Documentation:

We’ve recently added new user documentation demonstrating how easy it is to host RStudio and R Shiny web servers on NERC—with a frontend that can be up and running in under a minute.

Users have full flexibility to set up their own applications and servers:
